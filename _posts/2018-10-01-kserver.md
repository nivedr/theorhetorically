This blog post discusses the [2017 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01085) by Bubeck et al on k-server using multiscale entropic regularization.

## The Problem
$$k$$-server is a prototype problem to study in online algorithms. Given a metric space $$(X,d)$$, and requests (that correspond to points in the metric space) that arrive in an online fashion, the goal is to maintain a configuration of $$k$$ servers at points in $$X$$ such that:

1. a server is moved to the request point at the end of every iteration, and
2. the sum over all iterations of Earthmover distances between consecutive configurations of servers is minimized. This is the total cost of "realizing" the algorithm

Observe that the paging problem is a special instance of the $$k$$-server problem when the metric space is the uniform metric.

## Some prior results

The $$k$$-server problem was introduced in Manasse et al, and the authors conjectured a deterministic $$k$$-competitive algorithm for all metric spaces. This bound must be essentially tight for deterministic algorithms because the closely related "paging problem" has a deterministic lower bound of $$k$$. This lower bound is simple to see because an adverserial request sequence can maintain a set of $$k+1$$ pages that are requested in a round-robin fashion such that the request at every iteration is the page not present in the cache of the deterministic algorithm. The optimal solution would only have a page fault once every $$k$$ iterations if it swapped out the correct page.

### Best known deterministic algorithm for $$k$$-server
In general metric spaces, the best known result is due to Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou who presented a $$2k-1$$ competitive algorithm which they call as the "work function" algorithm. Given some initial configuration $$A_0$$ and a set of queries $$\rho$$ the work function $$w_{\rho} (C)$$ for some configuration $$C$$ is the cost associated with optimal set of moves starting from $$A_0$$ that end at $$C$$ such that the requests made at every iteration are respected. The work function for all configurations for some set of requests $$\rho = \{ r_1,\dots, r_n \}$$ can be computed using dynamic programming as:
\begin{equation}
	w_{ \{r_1,\dots,r_n\} } (C) = \min_{x \in C} \{ w_{\{r_1,\dots,r_{n-1}\}} (C \setminus x \cup \{r_n\}) + d(x,r_n)\}
\end{equation}
If at iteration $$n-1$$, the server configuration is $$S$$, in iteration $$n$$, the work function algorithm picks the configuration $$S'$$ that minimizes $$w_{\{r_1,\dots,r_n\}} (S') + D (S,S')$$ where $$D$$ is the Earthmover distance in the metric $$d$$. Intuitively, this decision takes into equal weightage the historical goodness of the configuration $$S'$$ (the first term) and the cost of moving the servers to $$S'$$ (the second term). This update rule can be computed in polynomial time because one need not check all possible configurations, it is sufficient to check those that move exactly one server to the request point. The competitiveness of the algorithm relies on the formulation of an appropriate potential function. As it would deviate from the scope of this article, further details of the proof are left out.

Of course one can hope to improve the guarantees if randomization is allowed. Once again, from the paging problem, there is a lower bound of $$\Omega (\log k)$$. This result follows from a puersuer-evader game. Consider the case where there are $$k+1$$ pages, and at every iteration the requested page is chosen uniformly randomly. The probability that there is a page fault is $$\frac{1}{k+1}$$. Therefore, 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:001}
\text{Expected number of faults in } t \text{ iterations} = \frac{t}{k+1}
\end{equation}
The coupon collector problem tells us that it would take $$(k+1) \log (k+1)$$ (upto additive constants) iterations on average for all pages to be requested. The offline solution would simply pick the last requested page to keep uncached, and therefore would see a cost of $$1$$ every $$(k+1) \log (k+1)$$ iterations. On the other hand the online optimal solution would incur a cost of $$ \frac{(k+1) \log (k+1)}{k+1} = \log (k+1)$$ (from \ref{eq:001}) which proves the lower bound.

### Hierarchically Separated Trees
HST's are classes of metric spaces on which one can once again prove lower bounds on the competitive ratio for $$k$$-server. HST's form an important class of metric spaces due to the breakthrough result by Bartal et al [] on probabilistic embedding of finite metric spaces into HST's. Their result explicitly states that for any finite metric space $$X$$, one can construct a set of HST metric spaces, $$\mathcal{S}_{HST}$$ and a probability distribution over this set $$P_{HST}$$ such that the expected distance between any two pairs of points suffers at most polylogarithmic distortion with respect to their true distance in $$X$$. Observe that this immediately implies that any good (randomized) algorithm $$\mathrm{Alg}_1$$ for $$k$$-server on HST's would give good (randomized) algorithms for $$k$$-server in general metric spaces by sampling a HST from $$\mathcal{S}_{HST}$$ as per $$P_{HST}$$, applying $$\mathrm{Alg}_1$$ on this HST, and performing the resultant action in $$X$$. Such an algorithm would have competitive ratio $$\mathcal{O} ( \mathrm{poly} (\log k ) ) \sigma (\mathrm{Alg}_1)$$ where $$\sigma (\mathrm{Alg}_1)$$ is the competitive ratio of $$\mathrm{Alg}_1$$ because,
\begin{align}
\mathcal{O} ( \mathrm{poly} (\log k ) ) \mathrm{Cost}\_{opt}^{X} &\overset{(i)}{\ge} \mathbb{E}\_{Y \sim P\_{HST}} \mathrm{Cost}\_{opt}^{Y} \quad [\text{By Bartal's probabilistic embedding}] \nonumber \\\\
&\overset{(ii)}{\ge} \mathbb{E}\_{Y \sim P\_{HST}} \frac{1}{\sigma\_{\mathrm{Alg}_1}} \mathbb{E}\_{\mathrm{Alg}_1} \mathrm{Cost}\_{\mathrm{Alg}_1}^{Y}
\end{align}
there is the implicit lower bounding of the optimal offline cost over $$X$$ by the optimal offline cost in each HST in $$(i)$$, and $$(ii)$$ follows from the competitiveness of $$\mathrm{Alg}_1$$.
 cost on this HST on average would not deviate more than by some polylogarthmic factor with respect to the cost over
